# SCC

A serial implementation of the **Hong Algorithm** that can be used to find Strongly Connected Components(SCCs) in a directed graph using . The algorithm exploits special properties of real world graphs to speed up the process of finding SCCs in large real world graphs.

### Data Sets
Data sets for large real world graphs can be obtained for free from [SNAP](http://snap.stanford.edu/index.html).
